# Fashion MNIST Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
The model learns to identify clothing categories such as shirts, sneakers, trousers, bags, etc.

The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
